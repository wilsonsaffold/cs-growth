# cs-growth
Tracking my journey to mastering computer science fundamentals and becoming a better software developer.

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized into three main categories:

- Algorithms: Classic and advanced algorithms with notes, walkthroughs, and code examples.
- Data Structures: Core data structures with explanations and implementations.
- Concepts: Key CS principles and patterns that appear in interviews and real-world systems.

## Why I'm Doing This

Too many people rely on AI to code without truly understanding what’s happening. I’m building this repo to:
- Deeply understand fundamental CS concepts
- Train for technical interviews the right way
- Write clean, efficient, and explainable code
- Push myself to read research papers and expand my knowledge

## Folder Contents

### Algorithms
- Binary Search
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Data Structures
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Linked Lists

- Bit Manipulation
- Dynamic Programming
- Memory: Stack vs Heap
- Recursion

## Personal Mission Statement

This isn’t about shortcuts. It’s about deep work, understanding, and becoming the kind of developer who can think critically, debug intelligently, and build systems that matter.
